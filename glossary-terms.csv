2065,ISCED 0: Early childhood education (includes ISCED 01 and ISCED 02),"ISCED level 0 programmes are usually school-based or otherwise institutionalised for a group of children (e.g. centre-based, community-based, home-based). ISCED level 0 excludes purely family-based arrangements that may be purposeful but are not organized in a ‘programme’ (e.g. informal learning by children from their parents, other relatives or friends is not included under ISCED 0).

Within ISCED 0, early childhood educational development programmes are targeted at children aged 0 to 2 years; and pre-primary education programmes are targeted at children aged 3 years until the age to start ISCED 1. The upper age limit for the pre-primary education category depends in each case on the theoretical age of entry into ISCED level 1. (See ISCED 2011 Manual, paragraphs 107-108)",ISCED 2011 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf,,,,,,,,
2067,ISCED 2: Lower secondary education,"Programmes at ISCED level 2, or lower secondary education, are typically designed to build on the earning outcomes from ISCED level 1. Usually, the aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon which education systems may then expand further educational  opportunities. Some education systems may already offer vocational education programmes at ISCED level 2 to provide individuals with skills relevant to employment.  Programmes at this level are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum, introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects. Teachers typically have pedagogical training in specific subjects and, more often than at ISCED level 1, a class of students may have several teachers with specialised knowledge of the subjects they teach. (see ISCED 2011 Manual, paragraphs 139-140)",ISCED 2011 http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-isced-2011-en.pdf,,,,,,,,
2150,Government expenditure on education as % of GDP,Government expenditure on education (current and capital) expressed as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a given financial year.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics,"To assess a government's policy emphasis on education relative to its national economic wealth. The Education 2030 Framework for Action endorses this indicator as a key benchmark for a government financing of education, allocating at least 4% to 6% of its GDP.",Government expenditure on education in a given financial year expressed as percentage of the GDP for the same financial year.,"Government expenditure on education by level of education, GDP data.","Data on education expenditure are provided by country governments through their responses to the annual UIS education survey and the UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection. The information used to complete the education expenditure questionnaire is typically sourced from annual financial reports issued by the Ministry of Finance/Economy or the Ministry of Education, or from national accounts books prepared by the National Statistical Office.  GDP data are sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) online database, which is updated quarterly, typically in March, June, September, and December. The calculation of the indicator is based on the June update for the UIS biannual data disseminations.",By level of education.,"In general, high values of the indicator denote strong governmental commitment and prioritization to education. This often suggests substantial investments in infrastructure, teacher salaries, educational materials, and programmes, potentially enhancing education quality and access.  In contrast, low values may suggest that education is less prioritized compared to other sectors. Insufficient funding can result in challenges such as overcrowded classrooms, underpaid teachers, or limited access to education, especially for disadvantaged groups.  Values of at least 4% to 6% indicate that the country meets the benchmark endorsed by the Education 2030 Framework for Action.  When disaggregated by level of education, this indicator informs about the emphasis of government policy priority across levels of education.","The indicator should be calculated using consistent and actual data on total government expenditures on education and GDP. Government expenditure on education should encompass all relevant ministries and administrative levels to ensure comprehensive coverage. Additionally, differences between fiscal year and academic year budget periods must be accounted for to maintain accuracy and comparability.  The UIS defines the protocols and standards for government expenditure data reporting by countries, and maintains a global database on the indicator.  The World Bank ensure GDP data quality by using standards, methodologies, sources, definitions, and classifications that are internationally accepted.  (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906534-data-quality-and-effectiveness)","In some instances, data on government expenditure on education refer only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries that may spend part of their budget on educational activities."

It is about lifelong learning and is an integral part of quality education.",Number of students at the relevant stage of education in a given year achieving or exceeding the pre-defined level of proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience within a given country or region and expressed as a percentage of the total number of students at the same level of education and year.,• Distribution of the number of children and/or young people in lower secondary in a given year who have achieved the pre-defined level of proficiency in knowledge of environmental science and geoscience. • Total number of children and/or young people in lower secondary who have participated in a given assessments. • ISCED mapping by country.,The data was sourced from the latest cycle of the IEA Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).,"Disaggregated by sex, location (rural/urban), and socio-economic status for each of the two components, cognitive and non cognitive, in the two dimensions, enjoyment of environmental science and geoscience and confidence in environmental science and geoscience.","The higher the percentage of students with an adequate understanding is, the better a given country is likely to be at building the foundations protecting the environment and earth.",The UIS maintains a global database on learning assessments in basic education. The inclusion of a data point in the database focus on consistency and overall data quality based on a set of objective criteria that include: data sources must include proper documentation and are mapping adequately to the content framework; data values must be representative at the national population level; data producers have in place quality criteria that are transparent and endorsed by participating countries.,"The source used to report was not designed to measure SDG 4.7.5. For this reason, the information has limitations related to the availability (e.g. the country coverage), sufficiency (e.g. inexistence of items to cover all the dimensions established in the global content framework), and relevance (e.g. the scales)."
3190,Pupil-qualified teacher ratio by level of education,"SDG Indicator 4.c.4: Average number of pupils per qualified teacher at each level of education (pre-primary, primary, lower and upper secondary education) in a given academic year.  A qualified teacher is one who has at least the minimum academic qualifications required for teaching their subjects at the relevant level in a given country in a given academic year.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,"To measure qualified teacher workloads and human resource allocations in educational institutions, and to give a general indication of the average amount of time and individual attention a pupil is likely to receive from qualified teachers.

Since qualified teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided the pupil/qualified teacher ratio is considered an important determinant of learning outcomes and an indicator of the overall quality of an education system.",The total number of pupils and students in the relevant level in a given academic year expressed as a percentage of the number of qualified teachers in the same level in that academic year.,Number of pupils and qualified teachers at each level of education in a given academic year.,Administrative data from schools and other organized learning centres.,By level of education and type of institution (public/private).,"The higher the pupil/qualified teacher ratio, the lower the relative access of pupils to qualified teachers. Results can be compared with established national norms on the number of pupils per qualified teacher for each level of education.","The indicator should be based on available data on students and on qualified teachers for the given level of education, from all types of educational institutions in the country (public and private). The UIS sets standards and maintains the global database used to produce this indicator.","The ‘ideal’ pupil/qualified teacher ratios may depend on a wide variety of complex factors, including the age and academic needs of the pupils represented in the ratio (younger children or those with special educational needs typically require more time, attention, and instructional support from teachers) or the experience, skill, and effectiveness of the teachers (highly skilled teachers may be able to achieve better academic results with larger classes than less skilled teachers with smaller classes).  In calculating and interpreting this indicator, one should take into account the existence of part-time teaching, school-shifts, multi-grade classes and other practices that may affect the precision and meaningfulness of pupil/teacher ratios. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers should be converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ numbers of teachers; a double-shift teacher should be counted twice, etc. Ideally, all staff involved in direct classroom-teaching roles should be included in the calculations.

Pupil/teacher ratios are not equivalent to the average class size. It is also important to note that national academic qualification requirements can vary from one country to the next. To address this limitation, the UIS has initiated the development of an international classification of teacher training programmes that can be used for comparisons of such programmes across countries."
3195,Youth/adult literacy rate,"SDG Indicator 4.6.1: Literacy is the ability to read and write, with understanding, a short, simple sentence about one’s everyday life. This definition emphases basic literacy, focusing on two core skills: reading and writing. The concept of literacy has since evolved to embrace several skill domains, including numeracy, each conceived on a scale of different mastery levels and serving different purposes.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,"Literacy represents a potential for further intellectual growth and contribution to economic, social, and cultural development of society. If disaggregated literacy rates help identify disparities within a population that hinder personal and social development allowing targeted interventions that promote social mobility and economic growth.  Numeracy, as a domain of literacy, refers to the ability to understand, use, and communicate mathematical concepts in everyday life. It includes basic arithmetic, interpreting data, and solving simple numerical problems. Unlike reading and writing, information on numeracy is not systematically collected in national population censuses and may therefore be underrepresented in the monitoring of this indicator. To better capture basic numeracy skills, further development of demographic censuses and sample survey instruments is needed, including the formulation of context-relevant and meaningful questions.","Percentage of the number of literate persons out of the total number of persons in the same age group, excluding persons with unknown literacy status.",Population in the relevant age group by literacy status (literate/illiterate).,"National population census, sample household or labour force surveys. Data on literacy are typically collected through self- or household-declaration in population censuses or sample household surveys that include a module on literacy and where data are collected based on self- or household-declaration.

Data are compiled through the following approaches:  - Data collection: from National Statistical Office and UNSD repository (UNdata), which compile data from national population censuses. - Microdata analysis: the indicator is calculated using microdata by the UIS and its partners such as the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEMR) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).  For regional averages calculation, the UIS applies the Global Age-specific Literacy Projections Model (GALP).","Literacy rate is disaggregated by age groups (15 years and above, 15 to 24 years old, 25 to 64 years old; and 65 years and above); location (urban/rural), and wealth (poorest/richest quintiles).","Literacy rates serve to inform how well a country's education system has been functioning, particularly at the primary level and/or literacy programmes. A strong correlation exists between literacy rates and a society's overall development. High literacy rates are linked to a better-educated workforce and a stronger economy.","Quality management: The UIS maintains a global database used to produce this indicator and defines the protocols and standards for data and metadata reporting by countries. For transparency purposes, the inclusion of a data point in the database is completed by following a protocol and is reviewed by UIS technical focal points to ensure consistency and overall data quality, based on objective criteria to ensure that only the most recent and reliable information are included in the database.  Quality assurance: The indicator by age groups should be produced based on consistent, national level (in case of census), or nationally representative (in case of sample survey) data on literate and illiterate populations according to national literacy definition.  Quality assessment: Criteria for quality assessment include data sources must include proper documentation; data values must be representative at the national population level and, if not, should be footnoted; data are plausible and based on trends and consistency with previously published/reported values for the indicator.","For most countries literacy is self-reported but there may be some challenges associated to changes over time in a given country and to differences in definition across countries.

Literacy should be differentiated from functional literacy. A person who is functionally literate can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of his [or her] group and community and for enabling him [or her] to continue to use reading, writing, and calculating for his [or her] own and the community’s development."
3197,"Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintiles and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated","SDG Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics.,To measure the general level of disparity between two sub-populations of interest with regard to a given indicator.,"Parity index: The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest.  Adjusted parity index: The parity index does not indicate whether improvement or regression is due to the performance of one of the groups.

The default calculation method for the parity index yields an indicator that is not symmetrical around 1 and that has no upper limit. This limitation can be overcome with a simple transformation, by inverting ratios that exceed 1 and subtracting them from 2. This adjusted parity index is symmetrical around 1 and lies in the range 0-2, which makes interpretation easier.",The indicator vales for the sub-populations of interest.,The sources are the same as for the underlying indicators for this goal.,None because the parity indices directly compare two sub-populations of interest.,"The further from 1 the parity index lies, the greater the disparity between the two groups of interest. For indicators that should ideally increase in values (e.g. gross enrolment ratios, completion rates, participation rates, etc), a parity index value less than 1 indicates disparity in favour of the advantaged group and a value higher than 1 indicates disparity in favour of the disadvantaged group. The interpretation of the parity index is the other way around for indicators that should ideally approach 0%, like out-of-school rates.",,"See section ""Calculation method""  Starting in September 2020, all parity indices are calculated with the formula for adjusted parity indices."

3249,Net enrolment rate in (a) pre-primary education and (b) early childhood educational development,SDG Indicator 4.2.4: Enrolment in (a) pre-primary education and (b) early childhood educational development of the official age group for the specific category of early childhood education expressed as a percentage of the population of the official age for the respective category.,UNESCO Institute for Statistics,To show separately the extent of coverage in each of the categories of early childhood education (pre-primary education and early childhood educational development) to the official age group corresponding to the respective category.,Number of pupils enrolled who are of the official age group for a given category of early childhood education expressed as a percentage of the population of the official age for the respective category.,Enrolment by single years of age in pre-primary education and early childhood educational development; population estimates by single year of age; and data on the structure (entrance age and duration) of each category of early childhood education.,Administrative data from schools or household survey data on enrolment; population censuses or surveys for population estimates by single year of age; administrative data from ministries of education on the structure (entrance age and duration) of each category of early childhood education.,"By sex from administrative sources; and by sex, location and income from household surveys.","A high NER for a specific early childhood education category denotes a high degree of coverage of pupils of the official age population for that category. The theoretical maximum value is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified category of early childhood education. When the NER is compared with the GER, the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%, then the complement, i.e. the difference with 100%, provides a measure of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified category of early childhood education. However, since some of these children could be enrolled in the other category of early childhood education or in primary education, this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the percentage of pupils not enrolled.","NER at each category of early childhood education should be based on enrolment of the relevant age group in all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide educational programmes at the specific category. The UIS sets standards, develops questionnaires and quality control protocols for country data reporting, and maintains the global database on the structure of education, and enrolment data by age. The United Nations Population Division (UNPD) produces and maintains population data. National population data that comply with UIS quality standards can also be used.","Difficulties may arise when calculating an NER that approaches 100% if the reference date for entry to the specific category of early childhood education does not coincide with the birth dates of all of the cohort eligible to enrol at this category. Although the NER cannot exceed 100%, values slightly over that ceiling (e.g. 105%) can be obtained reflecting inconsistencies in the enrolment and/or population data."
